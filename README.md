# Quiz App

This is the [Quiz App project (Day 46) in the Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to create a quiz that tests your knowledge and displays your score upon completion.

## Features

- Answer questions relating to technology/code.
- Receive your score upon quiz completion.
- Option to try again at the end of the quiz.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## My Process

- Start the files from a boiler template.
- Create a quiz template in the index.html file that will change each question utilizing the JavaScript code.
- Add styles for the template.
- Create an array in JavaScript for the quiz questions.
- Create variables for the target elements.
- Set the current quiz question and score to zero.
- Create the following functions:
    * A function to load the quiz.
    * A function to get the user selected answer.
    * A function to uncheck any selected answers.
- Add an event listener for the submit button:
    * If there are more questions, continue the quiz.
    * If the quiz has reached completion, reveal the final score and the opportunity to start again.


### Continued development

In this exercise I learnt how to populate a quiz utilizing a JavaScript array. I hope to combine this project with the Sound Board project from the same course and create a quiz that could be applied to e-learning.
